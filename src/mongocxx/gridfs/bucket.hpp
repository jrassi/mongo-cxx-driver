/// `<bucketname>.chunks.` A file written to a GridFS bucket will be serialized into zero or more
/// chunk documents stored in the `<bucketname>.chunks` collection, and one document will be stored
/// in the `<bucketname>.files` collection containing the information about the file. Users should
/// not modify these collections directly.
